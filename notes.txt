1. use `open` to read a text file
2. remove punctuation
3. normalize all words to lowercase
4. remove "stop words"
5. count the frequency of words
6. display a count in the console of words in descending frequency

do I need to read the file in every function?
how do I target the list of tuples (sorted_word_count) given returned from function print_word_freq? sorted_word_count doesn't exist outside the function.
